# Dynamic-Pricing-in-E-commerce-Using-Multi-Agent-Systems
The simulation shows that the agents effectively develop effective pricing techniques over time, resulting in increased incentives or profits.
In this paper, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) 
simulation in a marketplace scenario is provided, where sellers alter 
product pricing dynamically based on market conditions and individual 
profit expectations. The paper includes Python code that mimics the 
interaction of numerous sellers in a marketplace selling a set of items. 
The Deep Q-Network (DQN), Replay Buffer, VendorAgent, Product, 
and Marketplace classes are the core code components, each meant to 
satisfy various parts of the simulation.
